# java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to build applications for computers, mobile devices, and the web. It is known for its platform independence, meaning Java programs can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is widely used for Android apps, web applications, enterprise software, and games.
